# Mystic Seer

 <p>Mystic Seer is a ChatGPT AI App written in Vanilla Javascript. It uses ChatGPT3.5 model and OpenAI API. It is a project that I created to learn more about AI in general and how to implement it into a website while practicing my Javascript skills.</p>

<p>Mystic Seer demonstrates "The Barnum effect", a common psychological phenomenon whereby individuals give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically to them, yet which are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. This effect can provide a partial explanation for the widespread acceptance of some paranormal beliefs and practices, such as astrology, fortune telling, aura reading, and some types of personality tests.</p>

<p>The website artwork is Anaglyph. You can view it with 3D glasses for a crazy effect.</p>
